# INTRODUCTION

Loan management systems helps to automate the entire loan lifecycle. Depending on requirements, these programs can assist our life. The software can help with processing customer information, create new loans, and more. They can also provide lenders with accurate statements and reports. Moreover, they can manage interest rates and provide the tools for collection automation.
## Features of a loan management system:
### Loan Origination:
Loan origination is the process where a borrower applies for a loan, and the lender processes it. 
#### Loan Servicing:
The loan servicing feature helps to manage loans. Every loan is different: they have different interest rates, payment dates, and more. One can track all these loans and ensure to receive payments on time. It allows to calculate interests, fees, and more.
###  Debt collection:
Collecting back the payment is essential for lending businesses. A digital lending platform can notify you when accounts become delinquent. One can also get notified when the borrower pays back or when a repayment is due. The collection system can even calculate late fees for you.
## Benefits of a loan management system:
### Make lending easier:

Borrowers may need to borrow money for once. It is particularly true in the case of mortgages – where we have only one chance to make a good impression. Therefore, we have to provide our customer with a good lending experience. One can impart a good borrowing experience by making the application procedure online. On the operations front, we can automate credibility checks, automate the offer generation system, and make disbursal faster. 
Customers with better experiences are more likely to recommend your business to others. Recommendations like these will create new opportunities. Digital lending platforms are customer-centric systems. With self-serve portals, you can simplify the borrower journey and impress customers, especially the newer generation. 
Paperless processes:
As loan processing becomes more digital, document management has also become automated. Lenders no longer need to store files in large cabinets as everything is now centrally and digitally managed. We can view any file with a few clicks, and nothing ever gets lost.
